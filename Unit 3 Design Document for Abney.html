<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Well this is my 2nd class for my BA Degree. Last year I took a self pase execl course and enjoyed it. I just completed access with Southwesten also. I find it helpful to watch a lynda.com coures at when starting a new class to get an idea of what I am about to learn. I am married, is it weird that I have more photos of my dog then I have of me or my wife?</p>
